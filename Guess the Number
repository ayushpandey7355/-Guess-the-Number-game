 "Guess the Number" game. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.



the complete code for the game:

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

void playGame() {
    int randomNumber, guess;
    char playAgain;
    bool correctGuess = false;

    // Initialize random seed
    std::srand(std::time(0));
    randomNumber = std::rand() % 100 + 1;  // Random number between 1 and 100

    std::cout << "Welcome to Guess the Number!\n";
    std::cout << "I have selected a number between 1 and 100.\n";
    std::cout << "Can you guess what it is?\n";

    while (!correctGuess) {
        std::cout << "Enter your guess: ";
        std::cin >> guess;

        if (guess < randomNumber) {
            std::cout << "Too low! Try again.\n";
        } else if (guess > randomNumber) {
            std::cout << "Too high! Try again.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the number!\n";
            correctGuess = true;
        }
    }

    std::cout << "Would you like to play again? (y/n): ";
    std::cin >> playAgain;

    if (playAgain == 'y' || playAgain == 'Y') {
        playGame();  // Restart the game
    } else {
        std::cout << "Thank you for playing! Goodbye.\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    playGame();
    return 0;
}
